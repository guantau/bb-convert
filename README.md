# Currency converter for Byteball
This is a stand-alone currency conversion tool for Byteball wallet, which supports converting 24 different currencies into $GBYTE, $MByte $KByte and $Byte amounts and if Byteball wallet is already installed then it opens the wallet where user can simply click Send to initiate the payment. This tool solves the problem that Byteball wallet doesn't have a currency conversion tool built-in.

## Prefilled form fields
It is possible to prefill form fields and request somebody to send, for example, 1 million Venezuelan Bol√≠var (VEF) by sending a [link like this](https://tarmo888.github.io/bb-convert/#amount=1000000&currency=VEF&address=NTYO4ZKPRBPXW6WY2QUMJBPNDLOGX5OJ) (obviously with your own address). Just type in new values and it generates a new link on your browser address bar.

## TESTNET wallet
It is possible to launch a [TESTNET wallet](https://byteball.org/testnet.html) instead [MAINNET wallet](https://byteball.org/#download) by adding a `testnet=1` param to URL fragment [like this](https://tarmo888.github.io/bb-convert/#testnet=1).
